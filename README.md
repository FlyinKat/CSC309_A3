**Description**

Have you ever not purchased a good because it wasn’t exactly the most convenient to bring it home, or either shipping fees would end up being more expensive than the good itself? Project Fast is a community-based delivery service that is not only cost-effective, but also runs on a flexible schedule. Being in a nearby geographical radius from a certain location, people are able to connect with one another and share delivery services among the community through this application. Project Fast consists of two main roles: shoppers and couriers. The main idea of this application is that a shopper requests for a courier to pick up a good from a certain place, and the courier delivers it to his/her doorstep for a certain fee. Also, Project Fast provides a wide range of delivery services, from requesting someone to do a coffee run, or buying groceries from the supermarket to delivering a product from a friend’s house to the customer. 

**How it Works**

Project Fast is an online service where shoppers can find people willing to deliver goods to them. Couriers register on the system and list their location and how far they are willing to travel or a predetermined route they already planning to take. Shoppers register on the system and specify a store and a delivery location and then look for couriers able and willing to deliver for them. Shoppers and couriers then agree on fee for the service provided. The shoppers and courier create a social network where users can interact with each other. Once a user joins, they can communicate with each other to discuss the exchange of goods and services. Project Fast provides greater speed and fairer rates by accessing existing unused travel infrastructure.  

**Challenges for Project Fast**

The reliability of the agreement between the shoppers and couriers can be an issue. Providing a way to communicate in real time between couriers and shoppers will increase the reliability of the system. Shoppers will also be review and rank couriers giving the shoppers more information when deciding on a courier.

**Project Fast**

Project Fast will implement the following features:

* **User Authentication** : Each user will have an username and password.
* **User Profile** : Each user will have a profile with their location and reputation. 
* **User Interactions** : A user can be either a shopper or a courier.Couriers and shoppers can list a scource, destination and time. Users then browse through existing listings and contact the courier/shopper and either offer or receive delivery services. Users can also review and rank one another.
* **Implicit Social Networking** : In this social network, couriers and shoppers that have come to agreement are considered friends.
* **Reputation System** : The system will compute ratings for couriers and shoppers to determine their reliability. These will be small message with a numerical ranking as well as an aggregate ranking.
* **Administrative View** : Administrators will be able to see aggregate information such as the number of listings, number of successful deliveries, average agreed upon pricing and other useful analytics.

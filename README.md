Project Fast is a community delivery and time sharing service. In a typical household family members might ask each other to pick up something for each other while at the store. Project Fast extends this concept to an larger social network. Project Fast allows a community based on mutual interests and geographic location to connect to each other and share delivery services. This service will typically be attractive to people who live far from major reatail outlets and those that pucrhase from warehouse clubs.

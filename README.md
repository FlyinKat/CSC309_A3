**Description**

Have you ever not purchased a good because it wasn’t exactly the most convenient to bring it home, or either shipping fees would end up being more expensive than the good itself? Project Fast is a community-based delivery service that is not only cost-effective, but also runs on a flexible schedule. Being in a nearby geographical radius from a certain location, people are able to connect with one another and share delivery services among the community through this application. Project Fast consists of two main roles: shoppers and drivers. The main idea of this application is that a shopper requests for a driver to pick up a good from a certain place, and the driver delivers it to his/her doorstep for a certain fee. Also, Project Fast provides a wide range of delivery services, from requesting someone to do a coffee run, or buying groceries from the supermarket to delivering a product from a friend’s house to the customer.
